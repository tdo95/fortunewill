## How it's made  🏗
**Tech Used:** 

## Features 📱
- Dynamic 3d models and animations
- Question text validation
- Randomized generated responses
- Saves past fortunes accross sessions using local storage

## Lessons Learned 🎖
- How to work with 3d models and animations using three.js library
- Network performance can be optimized by reducing the size of file transfer
- Blocking functions can prevent rendering and inhibit user interaction - this should be avoided when possible
- Analyzing waterfall performance graphs within browser developer tools

## Future Improvements 📊
- Increase animation rendering speed to reduce loadtime latency - could further compress files
- Handle long text inputs
